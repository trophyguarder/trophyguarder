                        <h2>Engineering Design Internship - Protean Design Group</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Protean Design Group is a multi-disciplinary civil engineering firm specializing in Transportation, Traffic, Drainage, and Lighting Solutions with clients ranging from the Florida Department of Transportation to the Central Florida Expressway Authority. Protean fulfills multi-million-dollar contracts with the safest and most cost-effective design solutions across the state of Florida. At Protean, I worked alongside Project Engineers to design and plan production tasks in MicroStation. In MicroStation, I produced technical CADD drawings and diagrams relating to the success of each project, and revised the work of other engineers for quality assurance.</p>

                    <p>SR 408, also known as the East-West Expressway, is a 22-mile toll road running through the heart of Downtown Orlando. At Protean, I had the privilege of working on the SR 408 resurfacing project in the Traffic division. On this project, I mainly focused on developing Signing and Pavement Marking plans in MicroStation. Prior to the production of these plans, I was tasked with assembling a Condition Assessment Memo (CAM) to indicate the condition of existing signs on SR 408. Once the CAM was assebmled, I drafted technical plans indicating existing signs on SR 408 and indicated which signs were to be replaced and which were to remain. Throughout this process, I mastered the DrawSIGN program within MicroStation. At the end of the summer, I gave a presentation to the Traffic Division of Protean to show how DrawSIGN would simplify future projects and make them more efficient.</p>

                    <p>All engineering decisions that were made on the SR 408 project were backed up by extensive work in the field. I was able to accompany senior engineers on multiple site visits to collect data on everything from sign condition to pull pox inspection. Pictured above is field work conducted for the signalization aspect of the SR 408 project. In the field, I was able to apply the concepts that I learned in the office in a hands on manner. I would like to thank the Protean staff for an unforgettable summer and wish  them the best!</p>
