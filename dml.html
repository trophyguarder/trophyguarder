                    </header>
                    <p>As a part of the Design and Manufacturing Lab course (EML2322C) at the University of Florida, I was tasked with designing and manufacturing a robot capable of picking up five tennis balls from a tree and moving those tennis balls into a bucket on the other side of an arena. This project was split up into three design reports, each taking approximately 25-35 hours a week to complete.My group was composed of three individuals, including myself (shout out to Matthew Rebuck and Braydon Sabo for all of your help throughout this project!).</p>
                    <header class="major">
                        <h2>Design Report #1</h2>
                    </header>
				    <p>For Design Report #1, I had to create scale hand-drawn sketches of my concept and provide an estimate for cost and manufacturing time of this concept. Parameters for this design included staying below the $50 budget (not including motors, control box, or 6 feet of 80/20 aluminum extrusion), size restraints, and manufacturing time constraints.</p>

                        <h2>Design Report #2</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>After the individual design portion of the project was complete, I worked with my teammates to determine which components would contribute to the most successful overall design for our robot. To accomplish this, we analyzed each design using decision matrices and manufactured prototypes of components when needed.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>For the third and final design report, we were tasked with creating a final CAD assembly of our selected design based off of testing performed in Design Report #2. Along with the CAD model, we were required to create detailed part and assembly drawings for the entire design.</p>

                    <p>Finally, we were able to begin manufacturing components for our robot. Throughout this process, we were provided with hands-on manufacturing experience using CNC mills, lathes, CNC waterjets, bandsaws, and TIG welding. Sadly, our design was not able to come to fruition because in-person classes were cut short due to coronavirus. Had we been given one more class period of manufacturing, our robot would have been completed. Despite this, I gained a lot of practical engineering experience throughout this process. Big thanks to everyone that helped Group 6B succeed!</p>
